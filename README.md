# BigDataUtils
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ignasimg/BigDataUtils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ignasimg/BigDataUtils)

A few prototypes of various utilities to deal with big datasets.
Specially throught online algorithms.

##Utilities
- [x] MassMean - Utility to compute the mean, variance or std.Dev of a continuous stream of values, in an efficient way. While also being capable of removing some values from the calculation on a later date.
- [x] NeuralNetwork - Utility for classifiying.
- [ ] KMeans - Utility for clustering.
- [ ] InsertionSort - Utility for keeping a list always sorted.
- [x] TimedList - Utility to keep a list of items for a given time.
- [x] BuyOrRent - Utility to determine weather to 'buy' or to 'rent' - ski rental problem.
- [ ] WeightedMajority - Utility to choose the best prediction from a pool of predictions.
- [ ] Winnow - Utility for classifiying.

##TODOS
- [ ] Improve performance of NeuralNetwork class.
