# BigDataUtils
A few handmade utilities to deal with big datasets.
Specially throught online algorithms.

##Utilities
- [x] MassMean - Utility to compute the mean, variance or std.Dev of a continuous stream of values, in an efficient way. While also being capable of removing some values from the calculation on a later date.
- [x] NeuralNetwork - Utility for classifiying - learning method: online.
- [ ] KMeans - Utility for clustering.
- [ ] InsertionSort - Utility for keeping a list always sorted.
- [ ] TimedList - Utility to keep a list of items for a given time.

##TODOS
- [ ] Improve performance of NeuralNetwork class.
